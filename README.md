smb-scan
========

Python-based SMB Share scanner -- scans a bunch of computers, outputs the path and the file permissions for the account

Having a lot of issues trying to get this threaded. Libsmb issues.
Need a real database solution in order to get this off the ground

Please use this as a jumping-off point
