smb-scan
========

Python-based SMB Share scanner -- scans a bunch of computers, outputs the path and the file permissions for the account

Edit the settings in settings.py to be what you want to be.  Follow the formatting there.
Will output a flat file containing the Unix-style numerical permissions for the user account used

You may specify many targets in the targets.txt file, including networks.  Be sure to be classy ;) (192.168.1.0/24, not 192.168.1.1/24)

Please report bugs via Here, Twitter (@crypt0s) or gmail (Bryanhalf)

Enjoy.
